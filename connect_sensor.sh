#Copyright 2020, Active Countermeasures

#FIXME - check path for final script
#FIXME Consider allowing user to set custom sensor name
#FIXME - make sure you run this on the AI-Hunter server:	cd /opt ; if [ ! -e zeek ]; then sudo ln -sf bro zeek ; fi

#WARNING - DO NOT use the old approach of feeding this script directly into bash.  Something about sending it through a pipe
#(likely related to the 4k limit on pipe blocks) causes the script to exit prematurely.  Download it, then run it.
